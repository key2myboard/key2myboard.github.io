My story

Growing up I witnessed my mom make the difficult decision to leave an abusive relationship and step up as the head of household. She went from a stay at home mom to pursuing a career, enrolling into college, graduating with her masters, and accelerating in her career. But not only did I see my mom work hard to gain financial independence, I also saw her take on heavy manual work throughout our home, all without complaining. My mom was caring and soft, tending to delicate potted plants, while also strong and . It is her I see when I take on challenges that at first I didn't think myself capable of tackling. Possible is anything.

This led to the rediscovery of my passion for technology.

you just watch [my movie](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Princess_Bride_%28film%29) and it will answer **all** your questions.
